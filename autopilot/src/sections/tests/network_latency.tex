\section{Network Latency}
\label{sec:networklatency}

To support data-intensive tasks like those that require online processing of video or electrophysiological data, the networking modules at the core of Autopilot need high bandwidth and low latency. 

To test the latency of Autopilot's networking modules, we switch from "script mode" to "Task mode."
