\newthought{We have been testing and refining Autopilot} since we built our swarm of 10 training boxes in the spring of 2019. In that time 178 mice\sidenote{All procedures were performed in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines, as approved by the University of Oregon Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.} have performed over 6 million trials on a range of tasks. While Autopilot is still relatively new, it is by no means untested.

In this section we will present a set of basic performance benchmarks while also showing several of the different ways that Autopilot can be used. The code for all of the following tests is available as a \href{https://github.com/auto-pi-lot/plugin-paper}{plugin} that is further documented on the \href{https://wiki.auto-pi-lot.com/index.php/Plugin:Autopilot_Paper}{wiki}, and runs on a prerelease of v0.5.0.
