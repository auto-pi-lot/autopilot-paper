\newthought{We have been testing and refining Autopilot} since we built our swarm of 10 training boxes 10 months ago. In that time 115 mice\sidenote{All procedures were performed in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines, as approved by the University of Oregon Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.} have performed over 1.9 million trials on auditory two-alternative forced choice tasks. Our terminal has sent and received more than 42 million messages. While Autopilot is (by definition) immature at release, it is by no means untested.
