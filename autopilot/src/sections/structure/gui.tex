\section{GUI \& Plots}
\label{sec:ui}

The terminal's GUI controls day-to-day system operation\sidenote{Autopilot uses \href{https://wiki.qt.io/PySide}{PySide}, a wrapper around \href{https://www.qt.io/}{Qt}, to build its GUI.}. It is intended to be a nontechnical frontend that can be used by those without programming experience. 

For each pilot, the terminal creates a control panel that manages subjects, task operation, and plots incoming data. \href{http://docs.auto-pi-lot.com/guide.training.html#creating-a-subject}{Subjects can be managed} through the GUI, including creation, protocol assignment, and metadata editing. Protocols can also be \href{http://docs.auto-pi-lot.com/guide.training.html#creating-a-protocol}{created from within the GUI}. The GUI also has a set of basic maintenance and informational routines in its menus, like calibrating water ports or viewing a history of subject weights. 

The simple callback design and network infrastructure makes adding new GUI functionality straightforward, and in the future we intend to extend the plugin system such that plugins can provide additional menu actions, plots, and utilities.

\subsection{Plotting}
\label{sec:plotting}

\begin{marginfigure}[-3.5cm]
\begin{minted}[frame=lines,label=Trial Plot,fontsize=\small]{json}
{"data": {
    "target"   : "point",
    "response" : "segment",
    "correct"  : "rollmean"
},
"roll_window" : 50}
\end{minted}
\begin{minted}[frame=lines, label=Continuous Plot,fontsize=\small]{json}
{"data": {
    "target"   : "point",
    "response" : "segment",
    "velocity" : "shaded"
},
"continuous": true}
\end{minted}
\caption{\texttt{PLOT} parameters for Figure \ref{fig:gui}. In both, "target" and "response" data are mapped to "point" and "segment" graphical primitives, but timestamps rather than trial numbers are used for the x-axis in the "continuous" plot (Figure \ref{fig:gui}, bottom). Additional parameters can be specified, eg. the trial plot (Figure \ref{fig:gui}, top) computes rolling accuracy over the past 50 trials}
\label{fig:plotparams}
\end{marginfigure}

Realtime data visualization is critical for monitoring training progress and ensuring that the task is working correctly, but each task has different requirements for visualization. A task that has a subject continuously running on a ball requires a continuous readout of running velocity, whereas a trial-based task only needs to show correct/incorrect responses as they happen. Autopilot approaches this problem by assigning the data returned by the task to graphical primitives like points, lines, or shaded areas as specified in a task's \hyperref[sec:taskcomponents]{\texttt{PLOT}} dictionary (taking inspiration from Wilkinson's grammar of graphics\citep{wilkinsonGrammarGraphics2012}).

The GUI is now some of the oldest code in the library, and we are in the process of decoupling some of its functionality from its visual representation and moving to a model where it is a thinner wrapper around the \hyperref[sec:data]{data modeling tools}. Following the lead of formal models with strict typing will, for example, make plotting more fluid where the researcher can map incoming data to the set of graphical elements that are appropriate for its type. We discuss this further in \ref{future:gui}

%The top plot displays trial-by-trial information along the x-axis: each dot represents the target response (left = bottom, right = top), and each line segment represents the subject's actual response. A rolling mean of the subject's accuracy is plotted in gray. The bottom plot advances continuously, and displays the subject's velocity (shaded area) as well as the target and actual responses (as in top plot).
