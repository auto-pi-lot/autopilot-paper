\textit{We would like to acknowledge and thank Lucas Ott and Tillie Morris for doing most of the behavioral training and being so patient with the bugs, Brynna Paros and Nick Sattler for their help with constructing our behavioral boxes, Chris Rogers who has been brave enough to adopt and contribute to Autopilot in its roughest state, Arne Meyer, Mikkel Roald-Arbøl, and David Robbe who have contributed code and advice, Mackenzie Mathis, Alex Mathis, Gonçalo Lopes, and Gary Kane who collaborated on the DeepLabCut-Live project and provided many a mentorship along the way, Jeremy Delahanty for his inspiring tenacity and humbleness in thinking about better research tools, Matt Smear and Reese Findley for loaning us their Bpod for far longer than they intended to, John Boosinger and the rest of the staff in the machine shop for all their advice and letting me use all their tools, Erik Flister whose Ratrix software inspired some of the design features of Autopilot \citep{meierCollinearFeaturesImpair2011}, Santiago Jaramillo whose \href{https://github.com/sjara/taskontrol}{TASKontrol}\citep{jaramilloTASKontrol2022} gave inspiration for GUI design and served as an early scaffolding to learn Python, my labmates Molly Shallow and Sam Mehan who kept me afloat in my last months of dissertation writing, Rocky Penick for her help strapping Autopilot onto the back of Evan Vickers' mesoscope rig (and Evan for letting us play with his rig), several artists on \url{flaticon.com} (\href{https://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik}{Freepik}, \href{https://www.flaticon.com/authors/nikita-golubev}{Nikita Golubev}, \href{https://www.flaticon.com/authors/those-icons}{Those Icons}) whose work served as stems for some of the figures, and the Janet Smith House for the endless support and relentless criticism of the figures. This material is based on work supported by NIH NIDCD R01 DC-015828, NSF Graduate Research Fellowship No. 1309047, and a University of Oregon Incubating Interdisciplinary Initiatives award.}

\textbf{Contribution Statement}: JLS designed and wrote the software, documentation, wiki, figures, ran the tests, and wrote and edited the paper. LO trained the animals and did an extensive amount of beta testing, bugfinding, and made some of the hardware designs on the wiki. MW mentored, edited the paper, and beta tested the software.
